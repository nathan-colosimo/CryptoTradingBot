# CryptoTradingBot
A bot that trades cryptos 

Things that need to be fixed:
So right now, I need to make a few JS scripts to do the following...
     1) First one for signup - If psw & psw-repeat are the same, store all values in an array, move user back to login page. 
                                                Else, "psw and psw-repeat are not the same"
     2) Actual login - Compare login to stored array values. If similar, move user to mainpage.html. Else, "username or password is incorrect"
     3) Connecting API Keys to API - When building the API aspects, pull account keys from the doc file that stores values
